# 📊 Crypto Transactions Analysis - [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/douglas.chia/viz/CryptoTxsAnalysis/Dashboard1)

## ✅ 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Verified **no missing or null values** across all columns.
- Converted `Transaction_Date` into **datetime format** and applied **monthly aggregation** to identify trends over time.
- Filtered the dataset to focus only on **Completed transactions** for more accurate and actionable insights.
- Checked for and removed **duplicate entries** and **invalid values** (e.g., zero or negative amounts).

## 🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### General Observations
- Strong correlation between `Total_Value` and `Transaction_Fee` suggests a **proportional fee structure**.
- Most users made between **1–3 transactions**, spread across multiple platforms and wallet types.
- The dataset is relatively **balanced** across:
  - `Status` (Completed, Failed, Pending)
  - `Platform` (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
  - `Crypto` assets (Polkadot, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.)

### Key KPIs
1. **Transaction Count by Type and Platform**: Measures common user behaviors and preferred exchanges.
2. **Total Transaction Value by Wallet Type**: Identifies high-value users and custody preferences.
3. **Monthly Growth in Transaction Value**: Highlights user activity trends and app adoption.
